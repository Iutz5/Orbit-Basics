I worked with a buddy for a little bit during the lab time (Eunice Kim)

It took me about two hours to fully complete the lab

I loved the assignment! Personally, I thought it was a wonderful introduction to introducing variables and assigning a lot of variables allowed me to get a lot of practice in doing the repetitive steps

No other concerns for me! Thanks so much!
